# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Entities and Attributes:
- Entity1: Attributes
- Entity2: Attributes
...

## Relationships and Constraints:
- Relationship1 (Cardinality, Participation)
- Relationship2 (Cardinality, Participation)
...

## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):
- Explain how you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Design Choices:
Brief explanation of why you chose certain entities, relationships, and assumptions

## RESULT
In this experiment, we successfully designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a University
Database System. The ER diagram identifies key entities such as University, Courses, Students, and
Timetable, along with their respective attributes. The relationships among these entities-Offers, Takes,
and Has-were established with appropriate cardinality and participation constraints.
